    "section": "1.2 Why learn R?",
    "text": "1.2 Why learn R?\n\nR is free, open-source, and cross-platform. Anyone can inspect the source code to see how R works. Because of this transparency, there is less chance for mistakes, and if you (or someone else) find some, you can report and fix bugs. Because R is open source and is supported by a large community of developers and users, there is a very large selection of third-party add-on packages which are freely available to extend R’s native capabilities.\nR code is great for reproducibility. Reproducibility is when someone else (including your future self) can obtain the same results from the same dataset when using the same analysis. R integrates with other tools to generate manuscripts from your code. If you collect more data, or fix a mistake in your dataset, the figures and the statistical tests in your manuscript are updated automatically.\nR relies on a series of written commands, not on remembering a succession of pointing and clicking. If you want to redo your analysis because you collected more data, you don’t have to remember which button you clicked in which order to obtain your results; you just have to run your script again.\nR is interdisciplinary and extensible With 10,000+ packages that can be installed to extend its capabilities, R provides a framework that allows you to combine statistical approaches from many scientific disciplines to best suit the analytical framework you need to analyze your data. For instance, R has packages for image analysis, GIS, time series, population genetics, and a lot more.\nR works on data of all shapes and sizes. The skills you learn with R scale easily with the size of your dataset. Whether your dataset has hundreds or millions of lines, it won’t make much difference to you. R is designed for data analysis. It comes with special data structures and data types that make handling of missing data and statistical factors convenient. R can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data formats, on your computer or on the web.\nR produces high-quality graphics. The plotting functionalities in R are endless, and allow you to adjust any aspect of your graph to convey most effectively the message from your data.\nR has a large and welcoming community. Thousands of people use R daily. Many of them are willing to help you through mailing lists and websites such as Stack Overflow, or on the RStudio community. Questions which are backed up with short, reproducible code snippets are more likely to attract knowledgeable responses."

    "text": "1.3 Starting out in R\nR is both a programming language and an interactive environment for data exploration and statistics.\nWorking with R is primarily text-based. The basic mode of use for R is that the user provides commands in the R language and then R computes and displays the result.\n\n1.3.1 Downloading, Installing and Running R\nDownload\nR can be downloaded from CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network) for Windows, Linux, or Mac.\nInstall\nInstallation of R is like most software packages and you will be guided. Should you have any issues or need help you can refer to R Installation and Administration\nRunning\nR can be launched from your software or applications launcher or When working at a command line on UNIX or Windows, the command R can be used for starting the main R program in the form R\nYou will see a console similar to this appear:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile it is possible to work solely through the console or using a command line interface, the ideal environment to work in R is RStudio.\n\n\n1.3.2 RStudio\nRStudio is a user interface for working with R. It is called an Integrated Development Environment (IDE): a piece of software that provides tools to make programming easier. RStudio acts as a sort of wrapper around the R language. You can use R without RStudio, but it’s much more limiting. RStudio makes it easier to import datasets, create and write scripts, and makes using R much more effective. RStudio is also free and open source. To function correctly, RStudio needs R and therefore both need to be installed on your computer. For this training we’ll be using a browser based version called Posit Cloud (see directions in the Posit Cloud section below.\nRStudio interface is conveniently organized into four divisions called “panes”.\nThe Default Layout is:\n\nTop Left - Source: your scripts and documents\nBottom Left - Console: what R would look and be like without RStudio\nTop Right - Environment/History: look here to see what you have done\nBottom Right - Files and more: see the contents of the project/working directory here, like your Script.R file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe placement of these panes and their content can be customized (see menu, Tools -> Global Options -> Pane Layout)\n\n\n1.3.3 Posit Cloud (formerly RStudio Cloud)\nPosit Cloud is a web browser-based version of RStudio. It will allow you to use RStudio without needing to download anything to your computer. You can also easily share your R projects with others. To use Posit Cloud a user account is required. While we recommend downloading RStudio for routine R programming use, we will be using Posit Cloud for this training.\nTo access Posit Cloud\n\nIn a new browser window or tab create your account at https://posit.cloud/plans/free.\nLog in with Goolge or GitHub or however you choose!\nCreate a new project.\nWrite amazing code!"

Git manages the evolution of a set of files – called a repository – in a sane, highly structured way. If you have no idea what I’m talking about, think of it as the “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word on a raw vegan diet taking wheat grass and pomegranate shots 3 times a day.\nGit has been re-purposed by the data science community. In addition to using it for source code, we use it to manage the motley collection of files that make up typical data analytical projects, which often consist of data, figures, reports, and, yes, source code."

    "section": "3.2 What’s GitHub?",
    "text": "3.2 What’s GitHub?\nGitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab are online services that provide a home for your Git-based projects on the internet. If you have no idea what I’m talking about, think of them as DropBox but much, much better. The remote host acts as a distribution channel or clearinghouse for your Git-managed project. It allows other people to see your stuff, sync up with you, and perhaps even make changes. These hosting providers improve upon traditional Unix Git servers with well-designed web-based interfaces.\nEven for private solo projects, it’s a good idea to push your work to a remote location for peace of mind. Why? Because it’s fairly easy to screw up your local Git repository, especially when you’re new at this. The good news is that often only the Git infrastructure is borked up. Your files are just fine! Which makes your Git pickle all the more frustrating. There are official Git solutions to these problems, but they might require expertise and patience you can’t access at 3a.m. If you’ve recently pushed your work to GitHub, it’s easy to grab a fresh copy, patch things up with the changes that only exist locally, and get on with your life. Don’t get too caught up on public versus private at this point. There are many ways to get private repositories from the major providers for low or no cost. Just get started and figure out if and how Git/GitHub is going to work for you!\nWe will not be covering all the in’s and outs of version control with Git, GitHub and all the resources to be found there since our time is limited.

Since GitHub is moving away from username + password to push to their server it will be inevitable that you must set this up to work with GitHub from your local computer and RStudio. To create the token using usethis run:\n\ncreate_github_token()\n\nYou will see running this command takes you to a pre-filled form to create a new PAT. You can get to the same page in the browser by clicking on “Generate new token” from https://github.com/settings/tokens. The advantage of create_github_token() is that the usethis maintainers have pre-selected some recommended scopes, which you can look over and adjust before clicking “Generate token”. It is a very good idea to give the token a descriptive name, because one day you might have multiple PATs, e.g., one that’s configured on your main work computer and another that you use from a secondary computer or VM. Eventually, you’ll need to “spring clean” your PATs and this is much less nerve-wracking if you know which PAT is being used where and for what.\nYou must store this token somewhere, because you’ll never be able to see it again, once you leave this browser window. If you somehow goof this up, just generate a new PAT and, so you don’t confuse yourself, delete the lost token. In the moment, we usually copy the PAT to the clipboard, anticipating what we’ll do next: trigger a prompt that lets us store the PAT in the Git credential store.\n\n\n3.8.2 Put your PAT into the Git credential store\nNext you need to run:\n\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n\nYou will have the gitcreds package installed, as of usethis v2.0.0, because usethis uses gh, and gh uses gitcreds.\nIf you don’t have a PAT stored already, it will prompt you to enter your PAT. Paste!\nIf you do already have a stored credential, gitcreds::gitcreds_set() reveals this and will even let you inspect it. This helps you decide whether to keep the existing credential or replace it. When in doubt, embrace a new, known-to-be-good credential over an old one, of uncertain origins.\nHere are two great ways to check that all is well:\n\ngh::gh_whoami()\n\nusethis::git_sitrep()\n\nBoth of these functions reveal whether a GitHub PAT is discovered and provide information about the associated user, the PAT’s scopes, etc.\nThis step is something you do once. Or, rather, once per machine, per PAT. From this point on, usethis and its dependencies should be able to automatically retrieve and use this PAT."
